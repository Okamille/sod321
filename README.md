# SOD 321 - Discrete Optimization

Project repository for SOD321 course at ENSTA Paris

## TODO

- [x] Polynomial subtours constraints
- [x] Exponential subtours constraints
- [x] Visualisation of solution


## Usage

Solve a single instance with polynomial constraints:

```bash
julia main.jl polynomial aerodrome_20_2
```

Solve every instance with exponential constraints:

```bash
julia main.jl exponential all
```
